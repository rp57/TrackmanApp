# A Shiny App to Summarize Pitch Quality from a TrackmanÂ File

This repository houses the code to help build a Shiny app that allows users to upload a Trackman file and outputs the results of a Machine Learning Model to quantify pitch quality and success on a 0-1 scale. 

Scale:

0 - Lowest Possible Pitch Success Metric /n
~0.5 - Average /n
1 - Highest Possible Pitch Succcess Metric /n


Note: If your data has missing data for key pich metrics (velocity, break, etc.), those will be filtered out and affect the reliability of your results.
